## Push notifications on Android (Reels, 1080×1920, 60s)

`push-notification-android/push-notification-android.mp4` walks through how a push notification reaches an Android phone:

1. **Get a token**: the Firebase SDK registers the app with FCM and receives a registration token.
2. **Send it to your server**: the app uploads the token, and the backend stores it with the user's account.
3. **Server asks FCM**: the backend calls the FCM HTTP v1 API with the token and the message.
4. **FCM delivers it**: this goes over the single connection Google Play services keeps open for all apps. If the phone is offline, FCM queues the message until it reconnects.
5. **Android shows it**: in the background it goes straight to the notification tray. In the foreground it goes to `onMessageReceived()`. On Android 13+ the user must allow the `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` permission.

### Preview / re-render

- Open `push-notification-android/index.html` in a browser to watch it live. Click to pause, and use ←/→ to seek.
- Re-render the MP4 (needs ffmpeg with libx264 on `PATH`, or set `FFMPEG=/path/to/ffmpeg`):

```sh
npm install
python3 scripts/soundtrack.py push-notification-android/soundtrack.wav   # optional: regenerate audio
npm run render
```

`scripts/snapshots.mjs` grabs still frames at given times for quick review.
